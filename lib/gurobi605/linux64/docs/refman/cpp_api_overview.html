C++ API Overview
</H1>

<P>
This section documents the Gurobi C++ interface.  This manual begins
with a quick overview of the classes exposed in the interface and the
most important methods on those classes.  It then continues with a
<A HREF="cpp_api_details.html#sec:C++-details">comprehensive presentation of all of the available classes and
methods</A>.

<P>
If you are new to the Gurobi Optimizer, we suggest that you start with
the
<A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="../quickstart/quickstart.html">Quick Start Guide</A>
or the
<A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="../examples/examples.html">Example Tour</A>.
These
documents provide concrete examples of how to use the classes and
methods described here.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Environments</SPAN>

<P>
The first step in using the Gurobi C++ interface is to create an
environment object.  Environments are represented using the
<A HREF="cpp_grbenv.html#cppclass:GRBEnv">GRBEnv</A> class.  An environment acts as
the container for all data associated with a set of optimization runs.
You will generally only need one environment object in your program.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Models</SPAN>

<P>
You can create one or more optimization models within an environment.
Each model is represented as an object of class
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel.html#cppclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A>.  A model consists
of a set of decision variables (objects of class
<A HREF="cpp_grbvar.html#cppclass:GRBVar">GRBVar</A>), a linear
or quadratic objective function on those variables (specified using
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_setobjective.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::setObjective">GRBModel::setObjective</A>),
and a set of constraints on these variables (objects of class
<A HREF="cpp_grbconstr.html#cppclass:GRBConstr">GRBConstr</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grbqconstr.html#cppclass:GRBQConstr">GRBQConstr</A>,
or <A HREF="cpp_grbsos.html#cppclass:GRBSOS">GRBSOS</A>).  Each variable has an
associated lower bound, upper bound, and type (continuous, binary,
etc.).  Each linear or quadratic constraint has an associated sense
(less-than-or-equal, greater-than-or-equal, or equal), and right-hand
side value.

<P>
Linear constraints are specified by building linear expressions
(objects of class <A HREF="cpp_grblinexpr.html#cppclass:GRBLinExpr">GRBLinExpr</A>), and
then specifying relationships between these expressions (for example,
requiring that one expression be equal to another).
Quadratic constraints are built in a similar fashion, but using
quadratic expressions (objects of class
<A HREF="cpp_grbquadexpr.html#cppclass:GRBQuadExpr">GRBQuadExpr</A>) instead.

<P>
An optimization model may be specified all at once, by loading the
model from a file (using the appropriate
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel2.html#cppmethod:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> constructor), or built
incrementally, by first constructing an empty object of class
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel.html#cppclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> and then subsequently
calling <A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_addvar.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::addVar">GRBModel::addVar</A>
or <A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_addvars.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::addVars">GRBModel::addVars</A> to
add additional variables, and
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_addconstr.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::addConstr">GRBModel::addConstr</A> or
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_addqconstr.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::addQConstr">GRBModel::addQConstr</A>
to add additional constraints.  Models are dynamic entities; you can
always add or remove variables or constraints.

<P>
We often refer to the <EM>class</EM> of an optimization model.  A model
with a linear objective function, linear constraints, and continuous
variables is a <EM>Linear Program (LP)</EM>.  If the objective is
quadratic, the model is a <EM>Quadratic Program (QP)</EM>.  If any of the
constraints are quadratic, the model is a
<EM>Quadratically-Constrained Program (QCP)</EM>.
We'll sometimes also discuss a special case of QCP,
the
<EM>Second-Order Cone Program (SOCP)</EM>.  If the model contains any
integer variables, semi-continuous variables, semi-integer variables,
or Special Ordered Set (SOS) constraints, the model is a
<EM>Mixed Integer Program (MIP)</EM>.  We'll also sometimes discuss
special cases of MIP,
including
<EM>Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP)</EM>,
<EM>Mixed Integer Quadratic Programs (MIQP)</EM>,
<EM>Mixed Integer Quadratically-Constrained Programs (MIQCP)</EM>,
and
<EM>Mixed Integer Second-Order Cone Programs (MISOCP)</EM>.
The Gurobi Optimizer handles all of these model classes.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Solving a Model</SPAN>

<P>
Once you have built a model, you can call
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_optimize.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::optimize">GRBModel::optimize</A> to
compute a solution.  By default,
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_optimize.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::optimize">optimize</A>
will use the
<A HREF="concurrent_optimizer.html#sec:Concurrent">concurrent optimizer</A>
to solve LP models,
the barrier algorithm to solve QP and QCP models, and
the branch-and-cut algorithm to solve mixed integer models.  The
solution is stored in a set of <EM>attributes</EM> of the model.  These
attributes can be queried using a set of attribute query methods on
the
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel.html#cppclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grbvar.html#cppclass:GRBVar">GRBVar</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grbconstr.html#cppclass:GRBConstr">GRBConstr</A>, and
<A HREF="cpp_grbqconstr.html#cppclass:GRBQConstr">GRBQConstr</A> classes.

<P>
The Gurobi algorithms keep careful track of the state of the model, so
calls to
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_optimize.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::optimize">GRBModel::optimize</A>
will only perform further optimization if relevant data has changed
since the model was last optimized.  If you would like to discard
previously computed solution information and restart the optimization
from scratch without changing the model, you can call
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_reset.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::reset">GRBModel::reset</A>.

<P>
After a MIP model has been solved, you can call
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_fixedmodel.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::fixedModel">GRBModel::fixedModel</A> to
compute the associated <EM>fixed</EM> model.  This model is identical
to the input model, except that all integer variables are fixed to
their values in the MIP solution.  In some applications, it is useful
to compute information on this continuous version of the MIP model
(e.g., dual variables, sensitivity information, etc.).

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Infeasible Models</SPAN>

<P>
You have a few options if a model is found to be infeasible.  You can
try to diagnose the cause of the infeasibility, attempt to repair the
infeasibility, or both.  To obtain information that can be useful for
diagnosing the cause of an infeasibility, call
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_computeiis.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::computeIIS">GRBModel::computeIIS</A>
to compute an
Irreducible Inconsistent Subsystem (IIS).  This method can be used
for both continuous and MIP models, but you should be aware that the
MIP version can be quite expensive.  This method populates a set of
IIS attributes.

<P>
To attempt to repair an infeasibility, call
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_feasrelax.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::feasRelax">GRBModel::feasRelax</A>
to compute a
feasibility relaxation for the model.  This relaxation allows you to
find a solution that minimizes the magnitude of the constraint
violation.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Querying and Modifying Attributes</SPAN>

<P>
Most of the information associated with a Gurobi model is stored in a
set of attributes.  Some attributes are associated with the variables
of the model, some with the constraints of the model, and some with
the model itself.  To give a simple example, solving an optimization
model causes the <code>X</code> variable attribute to be populated.
Attributes such as <code>X</code> that are computed by the Gurobi optimizer
cannot be modified directly by the user, while others, such as the
variable lower bound (the <code>LB</code> attribute) can.

<P>
Attributes are queried using
<A HREF="cpp_grbvar_get.html#cppmethod:GRBVar::get">GRBVar::get</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grbconstr_get.html#cppmethod:GRBConstr::get">GRBConstr::get</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grbqconstr_get.html#cppmethod:GRBQConstr::get">GRBQConstr::get</A>, or
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_get.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::get">GRBModel::get</A>,
and modified using
<A HREF="cpp_grbvar_set.html#cppmethod:GRBVar::set">GRBVar::set</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grbconstr_set.html#cppmethod:GRBConstr::set">GRBConstr::set</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grbqconstr_set.html#cppmethod:GRBQConstr::set">GRBQConstr::set</A>, or
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_set.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::set">GRBModel::set</A>.
Attributes are grouped into a set of enums by type
(<A HREF="cpp_grb_charattr.html#cppenum:GRB_CharAttr">GRB_CharAttr</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grb_doubleattr.html#cppenum:GRB_DoubleAttr">GRB_DoubleAttr</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grb_intattr.html#cppenum:GRB_IntAttr">GRB_IntAttr</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grb_stringattr.html#cppenum:GRB_StringAttr">GRB_StringAttr</A>).
The <code>get()</code> and <code>set()</code> methods are overloaded, so the
type of the attribute determines the type of the returned value.
Thus, <code>constr.get(GRB.DoubleAttr.RHS)</code> returns a double,
while <code>constr.get(GRB.CharAttr.Sense)</code> returns a char.

<P>
If you wish to retrieve attribute values for a set of variables or
constraints, it is usually more efficient to use the array methods on
the associated <A HREF="cpp_grbmodel.html#cppclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> object.
Method
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_get.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::get">GRBModel::get</A>
includes signatures that allow you to query or modify attribute values
for arrays of variables or constraints.

<P>
The full list of attributes can be found in the
<A HREF="attributes.html#sec:Attributes">Attributes</A> section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Additional Model Modification Information</SPAN>

<P>
Most modifications to an existing model are done through the attribute
interface (e.g., changes to variable bounds, constraint right-hand
sides, etc.).  The main exceptions are modifications to the constraint
matrix and the objective function.

<P>
The constraint matrix can be modified in a few ways.  The first is to
call the
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_chgcoeffs.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::chgCoeffs">chgCoeffs</A> method on a
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel.html#cppclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> object to change individual
matrix coefficients.  This method can be used to modify the value of an
existing non-zero, to set an existing non-zero to zero, or to create a
new non-zero.  The constraint matrix is also modified when you remove
a variable or constraint from the model (through the
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_remove.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::remove">GRBModel::remove</A> method).
The non-zero values associated with the deleted constraint or
variable are removed along with the constraint or variable itself.

<P>
The model objective function can also be modified in a few ways.  The
easiest is to build an expression that captures the objective function
(a <A HREF="cpp_grblinexpr.html#cppclass:GRBLinExpr">GRBLinExpr</A> or
<A HREF="cpp_grbquadexpr.html#cppclass:GRBQuadExpr">GRBQuadExpr</A> object),
and then pass that expression to method
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_setobjective.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::setObjective">GRBModel::setObjective</A>.
If you wish to modify the objective, you can simply call
<code>setObjective</code> again with a new <code>GRBLinExpr</code> or
<code>GRBQuadExpr</code> object.

<P>
For linear objective functions, an alternative to <code>setObjective</code>
is to use the <code>Obj</code> variable attribute to modify individual
linear objective coefficients.

<P>
If your variables have piecewise-linear objectives, you can specify
them using the <A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_setpwlobj.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::setPWLObj">setPWLObj</A>
method.  Call this method once for each relevant variable.  The Gurobi
simplex solver includes algorithmic support for convex
piecewise-linear objective functions, so for continuous models you
should see a substantial performance benefit from using this feature.
To clear a previously specified piecewise-linear objective function,
simply set the <code>Obj</code> attribute on the corresponding variable to
0.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Lazy Updates</SPAN>

<P>
One very important item to note about attribute and model
modifications in the Gurobi optimizer is that they are performed in a
<EM>lazy</EM> fashion, meaning that they don't actually affect the
model until the next call
to <A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_optimize.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::optimize">optimize</A> or
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_update.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::update">update</A> on that model
object.  This approach provides the advantage that the model remains
unchanged while you are in the process of making multiple
modifications.  The downside, of course, is that you have to remember
to call <A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_update.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::update">update</A> in order to
see the effect of your changes.

<P>
If you forget to call update, your program won't crash.  The most
common symptom of a missing update is a <TT>NOT_IN_MODEL</TT>
exception, which indicates that the object you are trying to reference
isn't in the model yet.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Managing Parameters</SPAN>

<P>
The Gurobi optimizer provides a set of parameters to allow you to
control many of the details of the optimization process.  Factors like
feasibility and optimality tolerances, choices of algorithms,
strategies for exploring the MIP search tree, etc., can be controlled
by modifying Gurobi parameters before beginning the optimization.
Parameters are set using methods on
a <A HREF="cpp_grbenv.html#cppclass:GRBEnv">GRBEnv</A> object
(e.g., <A HREF="cpp_grbenv_set.html#cppmethod:GRBEnv::set">GRBEnv::set</A>).  Current
values may also be retrieved with
<A HREF="cpp_grbenv_get.html#cppmethod:GRBEnv::get">GRBEnv::get</A>.
Parameters can be of type <EM>int</EM>, <EM>double</EM>, or <EM>string</EM>.  You can also read a set of parameter settings from a file
using
<A HREF="cpp_grbenv_readparams.html#cppmethod:GRBEnv::readParams">GRBEnv::readParams</A>,
or write the set of changed parameters using
<A HREF="cpp_grbenv_writeparams.html#cppmethod:GRBEnv::writeParams">GRBEnv::writeParams</A>.

<P>
We also include an automated parameter tuning tool that explores many
different sets of parameter changes in order to find a set that
improves performance.  You can call
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_tune.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::tune">GRBModel::tune</A>
to invoke the tuning tool on a model.
Refer to the
<A HREF="parameter_tuning_tool.html#sec:Tuning">parameter tuning tool</A>
section for more information.

<P>
One thing we should note is that each model gets its own copy of the
environment when it is created.  Parameter changes to the original
environment therefore have no effect on existing models.  Use
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_getenv.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::getEnv">GRBModel::getEnv</A> to retrieve the
environment associated with a particular model if you want to change a
parameter for that model.

<P>
The full list of Gurobi parameters can be found in the
<A HREF="parameters.html#sec:Parameters">Parameters</A> section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Memory Management</SPAN>

<P>
Memory management must always be considered in C++ programs.  In
particular, the Gurobi library and the user program share the same C++
heap, so the user must be aware of certain aspects of how the Gurobi
library uses this heap.  The basic rules for managing memory when
using the Gurobi optimizer are as follows:

<UL>
<LI>As with other dynamically allocated C++ objects,
<A HREF="cpp_grbenv.html#cppclass:GRBEnv">GRBEnv</A> or
 <A HREF="cpp_grbmodel.html#cppclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> objects should be freed
using the associated destructors.  In other words, given a
<code>GRBModel</code> object <code>m</code>, you should call <code>delete m</code> when
you are no longer using <code>m</code>.
</LI>
<LI>Objects that are associated with a model (e.g.,
<A HREF="cpp_grbconstr.html#cppclass:GRBConstr">GRBConstr</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grbsos.html#cppclass:GRBSOS">GRBSOS</A>,
and <A HREF="cpp_grbvar.html#cppclass:GRBVar">GRBVar</A> objects) are managed by the
model.  In particular, deleting a model will delete all of the
associated objects.  Similarly, removing an object from a model
(using <A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_remove.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::remove">GRBModel::remove</A>)
will also delete the object.
</LI>
<LI>Some Gurobi methods return an array of objects or values.
For
example, <A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_addvars.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::addVars">GRBModel::addVars</A>
returns an array of <code>GRBVar</code> objects.  It is the user's
responsibility to free the returned array (using <code>delete[]</code>).
The reference manual indicates when a method returns a heap-allocated
result.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
One consequence of these rules is that you must be careful not to use
an object once it has been freed.  This is no doubt quite clear for
environments and models, where you call the destructors explicitly,
but may be less clear for constraints and variables, which are
implicitly deleted when the associated model is deleted.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Monitoring Progress - Logging and Callbacks</SPAN>

<P>
Progress of the optimization can be monitored through Gurobi logging.
By default, Gurobi will send output to the screen.  A few simple
controls are available for modifying the default logging behavior.  If
you would like to direct output to a file as well as to the screen,
specify the log file name in the <A HREF="cpp_grbenv2.html#cppmethod:GRBEnv">GRBEnv</A> constructor.  You can modify the
<A HREF="logfile.html#parameter:LogFile">LogFile</A>
 parameter if you wish to redirect the log to a
different file after creating the environment object.  The frequency
of logging output can be controlled with the
<A HREF="displayinterval.html#parameter:DisplayInterval">DisplayInterval</A>
parameter, and logging can be turned off entirely with the
<A HREF="outputflag.html#parameter:OutputFlag">OutputFlag</A>
parameter.  A detailed description of the Gurobi log
file can be found in the <A HREF="logging.html#sec:Logging">Logging</A> section.

<P>
More detailed progress monitoring can be done through the
<A HREF="cpp_grbcallback.html#cppclass:GRBCallback">GRBCallback</A> class.
The
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_setcallback.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::setCallback">GRBModel::setCallback</A> method
allows you to receive a periodic callback from the Gurobi optimizer.
You do this by sub-classing
the <A HREF="cpp_grbcallback.html#cppclass:GRBCallback">GRBCallback</A> abstract class,
and writing your own <code>callback()</code> method on this class.  You can
call
<A HREF="cpp_grbcallback_getdoublei.html#cppmethod:GRBCallback::getDoubleInfo">GRBCallback::getDoubleInfo</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grbcallback_getintinfo.html#cppmethod:GRBCallback::getIntInfo">GRBCallback::getIntInfo</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grbcallback_getstringi.html#cppmethod:GRBCallback::getStringInfo">GRBCallback::getStringInfo</A>,
or
<A HREF="cpp_grbcallback_getsolutio.html#cppmethod:GRBCallback::getSolution">GRBCallback::getSolution</A>
from within the callback to obtain additional information about the
state of the optimization.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Modifying Solver Behavior - Callbacks</SPAN>

<P>
Callbacks can also be used to modify the behavior of the Gurobi
optimizer.  The simplest control callback is
<A HREF="cpp_grbcallback_abort.html#cppmethod:GRBCallback::abort">GRBCallback::abort</A>,
which asks the optimizer to terminate at the earliest convenient
point.  Method
<A HREF="cpp_grbcallback_setsolutio.html#cppmethod:GRBCallback::setSolution">GRBCallback::setSolution</A>
allows you to inject a feasible solution (or partial solution) during
the solution of a MIP model.  Methods
<A HREF="cpp_grbcallback_addcut.html#cppmethod:GRBCallback::addCut">GRBCallback::addCut</A>
and
<A HREF="cpp_grbcallback_addlazy.html#cppmethod:GRBCallback::addLazy">GRBCallback::addLazy</A>
allow you to add <EM>cutting planes</EM> and <EM>lazy constraints</EM>
during a MIP optimization, respectively.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Error Handling</SPAN>

<P>
All of the methods in the Gurobi C++ library can throw an exception
of type <A HREF="cpp_grbexception.html#cppclass:GRBException">GRBException</A>.  When an
exception occurs, additional information on the error can be obtained
by retrieving the error code (using method
<code>GRBException::getErrorCode</code>), or by retrieving the exception message
(using method <code>GRBException::getMessage</code>).
The list of possible error return codes can be found in
the <A HREF="error_codes.html#sec:ErrorCodes">Error Codes</A> section.
