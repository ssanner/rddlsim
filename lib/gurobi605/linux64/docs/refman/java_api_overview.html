Java API Overview
</H1>

<P>
This section documents the Gurobi Java interface.  This manual begins
with a quick overview of the classes exposed in the interface and the
most important methods on those classes.  It then continues with a
<A HREF="java_api_details.html#sec:Java-details">comprehensive presentation of all of the available classes and
methods</A>.

<P>
If you are new to the Gurobi Optimizer, we suggest that you start with
the
<A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="../quickstart/quickstart.html">Quick Start Guide</A>
or the
<A NAME="tex2html9"
  HREF="../examples/examples.html">Example Tour</A>.
These
documents provide concrete examples of how to use the classes and
methods described here.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Environments</SPAN>

<P>
The first step in using the Gurobi Java interface is to create an
environment object.  Environments are represented using the
<A HREF="java_grbenv.html#javaclass:GRBEnv">GRBEnv</A> class.  An environment acts as
the container for all data associated with a set of optimization runs.
You will generally only need one environment object in your program.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Models</SPAN>

<P>
You can create one or more optimization models within an environment.
Each model is represented as an object of class
<A HREF="java_grbmodel.html#javaclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A>.  A model consists
of a set of decision variables (objects of class
<A HREF="java_grbvar.html#javaclass:GRBVar">GRBVar</A>), a
linear or quadratic objective function on these variables (specified
using
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_setobjective.html#javamethod:GRBModel.setObjective">GRBModel.setObjective</A>),
and a set of constraints on these variables (objects of class
<A HREF="java_grbconstr.html#javaclass:GRBConstr">GRBConstr</A>,
<A HREF="java_grbqconstr.html#javaclass:GRBQConstr">GRBQConstr</A>,
or <A HREF="java_grbsos.html#javaclass:GRBSOS">GRBSOS</A>).  Each variable has an
associated lower bound, upper bound, and
type (continuous, binary, etc.).  Each linear or
quadratic constraint has an
associated sense (less-than-or-equal, greater-than-or-equal, or
equal), and right-hand side value.

<P>
Linear constraints are specified by building linear expressions
(objects of class <A HREF="java_grblinexpr.html#javaclass:GRBLinExpr">GRBLinExpr</A>),
and then specifying relationships between these expressions (for
example, requiring that one expression be equal to another).
Quadratic constraints are built in a similar fashion, but using
quadratic expressions (objects of class
<A HREF="java_grbquadexpr.html#javaclass:GRBQuadExpr">GRBQuadExpr</A>) instead.

<P>
An optimization model may be specified all at once, by loading the
model from a file (using the appropriate
<A HREF="java_grbmodel2.html#javamethod:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> constructor), or built
incrementally, by first constructing an empty object of class
<A HREF="java_grbmodel.html#javaclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> and then subsequently
calling <A HREF="java_grbmodel_addvar.html#javamethod:GRBModel.addVar">GRBModel.addVar</A>
or <A HREF="java_grbmodel_addvars.html#javamethod:GRBModel.addVars">GRBModel.addVars</A> to
add additional variables, and
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_addconstr.html#javamethod:GRBModel.addConstr">GRBModel.addConstr</A> or
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_addqconstr.html#javamethod:GRBModel.addQConstr">GRBModel.addQConstr</A>
to add additional constraints.  Models are dynamic entities; you can
always add or remove variables or constraints.

<P>
We often refer to the <EM>class</EM> of an optimization model.  A model
with a linear objective function, linear constraints, and continuous
variables is a <EM>Linear Program (LP)</EM>.  If the objective is
quadratic, the model is a <EM>Quadratic Program (QP)</EM>.  If any of the
constraints are quadratic, the model is a
<EM>Quadratically-Constrained Program (QCP)</EM>.
We'll sometimes also discuss a special case of QCP,
the
<EM>Second-Order Cone Program (SOCP)</EM>.  If the model contains any
integer variables, semi-continuous variables, semi-integer variables,
or Special Ordered Set (SOS) constraints, the model is a
<EM>Mixed Integer Program (MIP)</EM>.  We'll also sometimes discuss
special cases of MIP,
including
<EM>Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP)</EM>,
<EM>Mixed Integer Quadratic Programs (MIQP)</EM>,
<EM>Mixed Integer Quadratically-Constrained Programs (MIQCP)</EM>,
and
<EM>Mixed Integer Second-Order Cone Programs (MISOCP)</EM>.
The Gurobi Optimizer handles all of these model classes.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Solving a Model</SPAN>

<P>
Once you have built a model, you can call
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_optimize.html#javamethod:GRBModel.optimize">GRBModel.optimize</A> to
compute a solution.  By default,
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_optimize.html#javamethod:GRBModel.optimize">optimize</A>
will use the
<A HREF="concurrent_optimizer.html#sec:Concurrent">concurrent optimizer</A>
to solve LP models, the
barrier algorithm to solve QP and QCP models, and
the branch-and-cut algorithm to solve mixed integer models.
The solution is stored in a set of <EM>  attributes</EM> of the model.  These attributes can be queried using a
set of attribute query methods on the
<A HREF="java_grbmodel.html#javaclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A>,
<A HREF="java_grbvar.html#javaclass:GRBVar">GRBVar</A>,
<A HREF="java_grbconstr.html#javaclass:GRBConstr">GRBConstr</A>, and
<A HREF="java_grbqconstr.html#javaclass:GRBQConstr">GRBQConstr</A> classes.

<P>
The Gurobi algorithms keep careful track of the state of the model, so
calls to
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_optimize.html#javamethod:GRBModel.optimize">GRBModel.optimize</A>
will only perform further optimization if relevant data has changed
since the model was last optimized.  If you would like to discard
previously computed solution information and restart the optimization
from scratch without changing the model, you can call
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_reset.html#javamethod:GRBModel.reset">GRBModel.reset</A>.

<P>
After a MIP model has been solved, you can call
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_fixedmodel.html#javamethod:GRBModel.fixedModel">GRBModel.fixedModel</A> to
compute the associated <EM>fixed</EM> model.  This model is identical
to the input model, except that all integer variables are fixed to
their values in the MIP solution.  In some applications, it is useful
to compute information on this continuous version of the MIP model
(e.g., dual variables, sensitivity information, etc.).

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Infeasible Models</SPAN>

<P>
You have a few options if a model is found to be infeasible.  You can
try to diagnose the cause of the infeasibility, attempt to repair the
infeasibility, or both.  To obtain information that can be useful for
diagnosing the cause of an infeasibility, call
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_computeiis.html#javamethod:GRBModel.computeIIS">GRBModel.computeIIS</A>
to compute an
Irreducible Inconsistent Subsystem (IIS).  This method can be used
for both continuous and MIP models, but you should be aware that the
MIP version can be quite expensive.  This method populates a set of
IIS attributes.

<P>
To attempt to repair an infeasibility, call
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_feasrelax.html#javamethod:GRBModel.feasRelax">GRBModel.feasRelax</A>
to compute a
feasibility relaxation for the model.  This relaxation allows you to
find a solution that minimizes the magnitude of the constraint
violation.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Querying and Modifying Attributes</SPAN>

<P>
Most of the information associated with a Gurobi model is stored in a
set of attributes.  Some attributes are associated with the variables
of the model, some with the constraints of the model, and some with
the model itself.  To give a simple example, solving an optimization
model causes the <code>X</code> variable attribute to be populated.
Attributes such as <code>X</code> that are computed by the Gurobi optimizer
cannot be modified directly by the user, while others, such as the
variable lower bound (the <code>LB</code> attribute) can.

<P>
Attributes are queried using
<A HREF="java_grbvar_get.html#javamethod:GRBVar.get">GRBVar.get</A>,
<A HREF="java_grbconstr_get.html#javamethod:GRBConstr.get">GRBConstr.get</A>,
<A HREF="java_grbqconstr_get.html#javamethod:GRBQConstr.get">GRBQConstr.get</A>, or
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_get.html#javamethod:GRBModel.get">GRBModel.get</A>,
and modified using
<A HREF="java_grbvar_set.html#javamethod:GRBVar.set">GRBVar.set</A>,
<A HREF="java_grbconstr_set.html#javamethod:GRBConstr.set">GRBConstr.set</A>,
<A HREF="java_grbqconstr_set.html#javamethod:GRBQConstr.set">GRBQConstr.set</A>, or
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_set.html#javamethod:GRBModel.set">GRBModel.set</A>.
Attributes are grouped into a set of enums by type
(<A HREF="java_grb_charattr.html#javaenum:GRB.CharAttr">GRB.CharAttr</A>,
<A HREF="java_grb_doubleattr.html#javaenum:GRB.DoubleAttr">GRB.DoubleAttr</A>,
<A HREF="java_grb_intattr.html#javaenum:GRB.IntAttr">GRB.IntAttr</A>, 
<A HREF="java_grb_stringattr.html#javaenum:GRB.StringAttr">GRB.StringAttr</A>).
The <code>get()</code> and <code>set()</code> methods are overloaded, so the
type of the attribute determines the type of the returned value.
Thus, <code>constr.get(GRB_DoubleAttr_RHS)</code> returns a double,
while <code>constr.get(GRB_CharAttr_Sense)</code> returns a char.

<P>
If you wish to retrieve attribute values for a set of variables or
constraints, it is usually more efficient to use the array methods on
the associated <A HREF="java_grbmodel.html#javaclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> object.
Method
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_get.html#javamethod:GRBModel.get">GRBModel.get</A>
includes signatures that allow you to query or modify attribute values
for one-, two-, and three-dimensional arrays of variables or
constraints.

<P>
The full list of attributes can be found in the
<A HREF="attributes.html#sec:Attributes">Attributes</A> section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Additional Model Modification Information</SPAN>

<P>
Most modifications to an existing model are done through the attribute
interface (e.g., changes to variable bounds, constraint right-hand
sides, etc.).  The main exceptions are modifications to the constraint
matrix and to the objective function.

<P>
The constraint matrix can be modified in a few ways.  The first is to
call the <A HREF="java_grbmodel_chgcoeff.html#javamethod:GRBModel.chgCoeff">chgCoeff</A> method
on a <A HREF="java_grbmodel.html#javaclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> object to change
individual matrix coefficients.  This method can be used to modify the
value of an existing non-zero, to set an existing non-zero to zero, or
to create a new non-zero.  The constraint matrix is also modified when
you remove a variable or constraint from the model (through the
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_remove.html#javamethod:GRBModel.remove">GRBModel.remove</A> method).
The non-zero values associated with the deleted constraint or
variable are removed along with the constraint or variable itself.

<P>
The model objective function can also be modified in a few ways.  The
easiest is to build an expression that captures the objective function
(a <A HREF="java_grblinexpr.html#javaclass:GRBLinExpr">GRBLinExpr</A> or
<A HREF="java_grbquadexpr.html#javaclass:GRBQuadExpr">GRBQuadExpr</A> object),
and then pass that expression to method
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_setobjective.html#javamethod:GRBModel.setObjective">GRBModel.setObjective</A>.
If you wish to modify the objective, you can simply call
<code>setObjective</code> again with a new <code>GRBLinExpr</code> or
<code>GRBQuadExpr</code> object.

<P>
For linear objective functions, an alternative to <code>setObjective</code>
is to use the <code>Obj</code> variable attribute to modify individual
linear objective coefficients.

<P>
If your variables have piecewise-linear objectives, you can specify
them using the <A HREF="java_grbmodel_setpwlobj.html#javamethod:GRBModel.setPWLObj">setPWLObj</A>
method.  Call this method once for each relevant variable.  The Gurobi
simplex solver includes algorithmic support for convex
piecewise-linear objective functions, so for continuous models you
should see a substantial performance benefit from using this feature.
To clear a previously specified piecewise-linear objective function,
simply set the <code>Obj</code> attribute on the corresponding variable to
0.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Lazy Updates</SPAN>

<P>
One very important item to note about attribute and model
modifications in the Gurobi optimizer is that they are performed in a
<EM>lazy</EM> fashion, meaning that they don't actually affect the
model until the next call
to <A HREF="java_grbmodel_optimize.html#javamethod:GRBModel.optimize">optimize</A> or
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_update.html#javamethod:GRBModel.update">update</A> on that model
object.  This approach provides the advantage that the model remains
unchanged while you are in the process of making multiple
modifications.  The downside, of course, is that you have to remember
to call <A HREF="java_grbmodel_update.html#javamethod:GRBModel.update">update</A> in order to
see the effect of your changes.

<P>
If you forget to call update, your program won't crash.  The most
common symptom of a missing update is a <TT>NOT_IN_MODEL</TT>
exception, which indicates that the object you are trying to reference
isn't in the model yet.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Managing Parameters</SPAN>

<P>
The Gurobi optimizer provides a set of parameters to allow you to
control many of the details of the optimization process.  Factors like
feasibility and optimality tolerances, choices of algorithms,
strategies for exploring the MIP search tree, etc., can be controlled
by modifying Gurobi parameters before beginning the optimization.
Parameters are set using method
<A HREF="java_grbenv_set.html#javamethod:GRBEnv.set">GRBEnv.set</A>.
Current values may also be retrieved with
<A HREF="java_grbenv_get.html#javamethod:GRBEnv.get">GRBEnv.get</A>.
Parameters can be of type <EM>int</EM>, <EM>double</EM>, or <EM>String</EM>.  You can also read a set of parameter settings from a file
using
<A HREF="java_grbenv_readparams.html#javamethod:GRBEnv.readParams">GRBEnv.readParams</A>,
or write the set of changed parameters using
<A HREF="java_grbenv_writeparams.html#javamethod:GRBEnv.writeParams">GRBEnv.writeParams</A>.

<P>
We also include an automated parameter tuning tool that explores many
different sets of parameter changes in order to find a set that
improves performance.  You can call
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_tune.html#javamethod:GRBModel.tune">GRBModel.tune</A>
to invoke the tuning tool on a model.
Refer to the
<A HREF="parameter_tuning_tool.html#sec:Tuning">parameter tuning tool</A>
section for more information.

<P>
One thing we should note is that each model gets its own copy
of the environment when it is created.  Parameter changes to the
original environment therefore have no effect on existing models.  Use
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_getenv.html#javamethod:GRBModel.getEnv">GRBModel.getEnv</A> to retrieve the
environment associated with a particular model if you want to change a
parameter for that model.

<P>
The full list of Gurobi parameters can be found in the
<A HREF="parameters.html#sec:Parameters">Parameters</A> section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Memory Management</SPAN>

<P>
Users typically do not need to concern themselves with memory
management in Java, since it is handled automatically by the garbage
collector.  The Gurobi Java interface utilizes the same garbage
collection mechanism as other Java programs, but there are a few
specifics of our memory management that users should be aware of.

<P>
In general, Gurobi objects live in the same Java heap as other Java
objects.  When they are no longer referenced, they become candidates
for garbage collection, and are returned to the pool of free space at
the next invocation of the garbage collector.  Two important exceptions
are the
<A HREF="java_grbenv.html#javaclass:GRBEnv">GRBEnv</A> and
<A HREF="java_grbmodel.html#javaclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> objects.
A <code>GRBModel</code> object has a small amount of memory associated with
it in the Java heap, but the majority of the space associated with a
model lives in the heap of the Gurobi native code library (the Gurobi
DLL in Windows, or the Gurobi shared library in Linux or Mac).  The
Java heap manager is unaware of the memory associated with the model
in the native code library, so it does not consider this memory usage
when deciding whether to invoke the garbage collector.  When the
garbage collector eventually collects the Java <code>GRBModel</code>
object, the memory associated with the model in the Gurobi native
code library will be freed, but this collection may come later than
you might want.  Similar considerations apply to the <code>GRBEnv</code>
object.

<P>
If you are writing a Java program that makes use of multiple Gurobi
models or environments, we recommend that you call
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_dispose.html#javamethod:GRBModel.dispose">GRBModel.dispose</A>
when you are done using the associated <code>GRBModel</code> object,
and
<A HREF="java_grbenv_dispose.html#javamethod:GRBEnv.dispose">GRBEnv.dispose</A>
when you are done using the associated
<code>GRBEnv</code> object and after you have called
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_dispose.html#javamethod:GRBModel.dispose">GRBModel.dispose</A> on
all of the models created using that <code>GRBEnv</code> object.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Native Code</SPAN>

<P>
As noted earlier, the Gurobi Java interface is a thin layer that sits
on top of our native code library (the Gurobi DLL on Windows, and the
Gurobi shared library on Linux or Mac).  Thus, an application that
uses the Gurobi Java library will load the Gurobi native code library
at runtime.  In order for this happen, you need to make sure that two
things are true.  First, you need to make sure that the native code
library is available in the search path of the target machine (<code>PATH</code>
 on Windows, <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> on Linux,
or <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> on Mac).  These
paths are set up as part of the installation of the Gurobi Optimizer,
but may not be configured appropriately on a machine where the full
Gurobi Optimizer has not been installed.  Second, you need to be sure
that the Java JVM and the Gurobi native library use the same object
format.  In particular, you need to use the 32-bit Gurobi native
library with a 32-bit Java JVM, and similarly the 64-bit Gurobi native
library with a 64-bit Java JVM.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Monitoring Progress - Logging and Callbacks</SPAN>

<P>
Progress of the optimization can be monitored through Gurobi logging.
By default, Gurobi will send output to the screen.  A few simple
controls are available for modifying the default logging behavior.  If
you would like to direct output to a file as well as to the screen,
specify the log file name in the <A HREF="java_grbenv2.html#javamethod:GRBEnv">GRBEnv</A> constructor.  You can modify the
<A HREF="logfile.html#parameter:LogFile">LogFile</A>
parameter if you wish to redirect the log to a
different file after creating the environment object.  The frequency
of logging output can be controlled with the
<A HREF="displayinterval.html#parameter:DisplayInterval">DisplayInterval</A>
parameter, and logging can be turned off entirely with the
<A HREF="outputflag.html#parameter:OutputFlag">OutputFlag</A>
parameter.  A detailed description of the Gurobi log
file can be found in the <A HREF="logging.html#sec:Logging">Logging</A> section.

<P>
More detailed progress monitoring can be done through the
<A HREF="java_grbcallback.html#javaclass:GRBCallback">GRBCallback</A> class.
The
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_setcallback.html#javamethod:GRBModel.setCallback">GRBModel.setCallback</A> method
allows you to receive a periodic callback from the Gurobi optimizer.
You do this by sub-classing
the <A HREF="java_grbcallback.html#javaclass:GRBCallback">GRBCallback</A> abstract class,
and writing your own <code>Callback()</code> method on this class.  You can
call
<A HREF="java_grbcallback_getdouble.html#javamethod:GRBCallback.getDoubleInfo">GRBCallback.getDoubleInfo</A>,
<A HREF="java_grbcallback_getintinf.html#javamethod:GRBCallback.getIntInfo">GRBCallback.getIntInfo</A>,
<A HREF="java_grbcallback_getstring.html#javamethod:GRBCallback.getStringInfo">GRBCallback.getStringInfo</A>,
or
<A HREF="java_grbcallback_getsoluti.html#javamethod:GRBCallback.getSolution">GRBCallback.getSolution</A>
from within the callback to obtain additional information about the
state of the optimization.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Modifying Solver Behavior - Callbacks</SPAN>

<P>
Callbacks can also be used to modify the behavior of the Gurobi
optimizer.  The simplest control callback is
<A HREF="java_grbcallback_abort.html#javamethod:GRBCallback.abort">GRBCallback.abort</A>,
which asks the optimizer to terminate at the earliest convenient
point.  Method
<A HREF="java_grbcallback_setsoluti.html#javamethod:GRBCallback.setSolution">GRBCallback.setSolution</A>
allows you to inject a feasible solution (or partial solution) during
the solution of a MIP model.  Methods
<A HREF="java_grbcallback_addcut.html#javamethod:GRBCallback.addCut">GRBCallback.addCut</A>
and
<A HREF="java_grbcallback_addlazy.html#javamethod:GRBCallback.addLazy">GRBCallback.addLazy</A>
allow you to add <EM>cutting planes</EM> and <EM>lazy constraints</EM>
during a MIP optimization, respectively.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Error Handling</SPAN>

<P>
All of the methods in the Gurobi Java library can throw an exception
of type <A HREF="java_grbexception.html#javaclass:GRBException">GRBException</A>.  When an
exception occurs, additional information on the error can be obtained
by retrieving the error code (using method
<A HREF="java_grbexception_geterror.html#javamethod:GRBException.getErrorCode">GRBException.getErrorCode</A>),
or by retrieving the exception message (using method
<code>GRBException.getMessage</code> from the parent class).  The list of
possible error return codes can be found in the <A HREF="error_codes.html#sec:ErrorCodes">Error
Codes</A> section.
