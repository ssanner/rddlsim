Concurrent Optimizer
</H1>

<P>
Concurrent optimization is a simple approach for exploiting multiple
processors.  It starts multiple, independent solves on a model, using
different strategies for each.  Optimization terminates when the
first one completes.  By pursuing multiple different strategies
simultaneously, the concurrent optimizer can often obtain a solution
faster than it would if it had to choose a single strategy.

<P>
Concurrent optimization is our default choice for solving LP models,
and a user-selectable option for solving MIP models.  The concurrent
optimizer can be controlled in a few different ways.  These will be
discussed in this section.  To avoid confusion when reporting results
from multiple simultaneous solves, we've chosen to produce simplified
<A HREF="#sec:ConcurrentLog">logs</A> and
<A HREF="#sec:ConcurrentCallbacks">callbacks</A> when performing
concurrent optimization.  These will also be discussed in this
section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Controlling Concurrent Optimization</SPAN>
<A NAME="sec:ConcurrentControl"></A>
<P>
If you wish to use the concurrent optimizer to solve your model, the
steps you need to take depend on the model type.  As mentioned
earlier, the concurrent optimizer is the default choice for LP models.
This choice is controlled by the
<A HREF="method.html#parameter:Method">Method</A> parameter.  For MIP models,
you can select the concurrent optimizer by modifying the
<A HREF="concurrentmip.html#parameter:ConcurrentMIP">ConcurrentMIP</A> parameter.

<P>
When controlling the concurrent optimizer using these parameters, the
strategies used for the different independent solves are chosen
automatically.  While we reserve the right to change our choices in
the future, for LP models we currently devote the first concurrent
thread to dual simplex, the second through fourth to a single parallel
barrier solve, and the fifth to primal simplex.  Additional threads
are devoted to the one parallel barrier solve.  Thus, for example, a
concurrent LP solve using four threads would devote one thread to dual
simplex and three to parallel barrier.  For MIP, we divide available
threads evenly among the independent solves, and we choose different
values for the <A HREF="mipfocus.html#parameter:MIPFocus">MIPFocus</A> and
<A HREF="seed.html#parameter:Seed">Seed</A> parameters for each.

<P>
If you want more control over concurrent optimization (e.g., to choose
the exact strategies used for each independent solve), you can do so
by creating two or more <EM>concurrent environments</EM>.  These can be
created via API routines (in
<A HREF="c_grbgetconcurrentenv.html#routine:GRBgetconcurrentenv">C</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_getconcurrent.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::getConcurrentEnv">C++</A>,
<A HREF="java_grbmodel_getconcurren.html#javamethod:GRBModel.getConcurrentEnv">Java</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_getconcurrente.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.GetConcurrentEnv">.NET</A>, or
<A HREF="py_model_getconcurrentenv.html#pythonmethod:Model.getConcurrentEnv">Python</A>), or they
can be created from <code>.prm</code> files using the
<A HREF="concurrentsettings.html#parameter:ConcurrentSettings">ConcurrentSettings</A>
parameter if you are using our command-line interface.  Once these
have been created, subsequent optimization calls will start one
independent solve for each concurrent environment you created.  To
control the strategies used for each solve, you simply set the
parameters in each environment to the values you would like them to
take in the corresponding solve.  For example, if you create two
concurrent environments and set the <code>MIPFocus</code> parameter to 1 in
the first and 2 in the second, subsequent MIP optimize calls will
perform two solves in parallel, one with <code>MIPFocus=1</code> and the
other with <code>MIPFocus=2</code>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Logging</SPAN>
<A NAME="sec:ConcurrentLog"></A>
<P>
Your first indication that the concurrent optimizer is being used is
output in the Gurobi log that looks like this...
<PRE>
Concurrent LP optimizer: dual simplex and barrier
Showing barrier log only...
</PRE>
...or like this...
<PRE>
Concurrent MIP optimizer: 2 concurrent instances (2 threads per instance)
</PRE>
These log lines indicate how many independent solves will be launched.
For the LP case, the lines also indicate which methods will be used
for each.

<P>
Since it would be quite confusing to see results from multiple solves
interleaved in a single log, we've chosen to use a simplified log
format for concurrent optimization.  For concurrent LP, we only
present the log for a single solve.  For concurrent MIP, the log is
similar to our standard MIP log, except that it only provides periodic
summary information (see the <A HREF="mip_logging.html#sec:MIPLogging">MIP
  logging</A> section if you are unfamiliar with our
standard MIP log).  Each concurrent MIP log line shows the objective
for the best feasible solution found by any of the independent solves
to that point, the best objective bound proved by any of the
independent solves, and the relative gap between these two values:

</PRE>
We also include node counts from one of the independent solves, as
well as elapsed times, to give some indication of forward progress.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Callbacks</SPAN>
<A NAME="sec:ConcurrentCallbacks"></A>
<P>
Rather than providing callbacks from multiple independent solves
simultaneously, we've again chosen to simplify behavior for the
concurrent optimizer.  In particular, we only supply callbacks from a
single solve.  A few consequences of this choice:

<UL>
<LI>Information retrieved by your callback (solutions,
  objective bounds, etc.) will come from a single model.
</LI>
<LI>User cutting planes are only applied to a single model.
</LI>
<LI>You aren't allowed to use lazy constraints with concurrent MIP,
  since they would only be applied to one model.
</LI>
</UL>
