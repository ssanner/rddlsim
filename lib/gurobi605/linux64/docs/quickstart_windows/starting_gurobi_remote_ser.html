Starting Gurobi Remote Services
</H2>

<P>
<B>Important note: you only need to start Gurobi Remote Services if you are
  setting up a Compute Server or a distributed worker (for use in distributed
  algorihms).  If you are not
  sure whether you need to start Gurobi Remote Services, you can examine the
  contents of your <code>gurobi.lic</code> file.  If it contains the line
  <code>CSENABLED=1</code>, then you need Gurobi Remote Services.
  If it contains a line that begins with <code>DISTRIBUTED=</code>, and if
  you plan to run distributed algorithms, then you also need Gurobi
  Remote Services.</B>

<P>
On Windows systems, Gurobi Remote Services is a Windows Service that
allows a server to perform Gurobi computations on behalf of other
client machines.  The set of services the server provides depends on
your license.  If you are setting up a machine as a distributed
worker, no license is required.  In this case, the only service
provided by the server is to act as a worker in a distributed
algorithm.  If you have a Compute Server license, then servers running
Gurobi Remote Services can provide a variety of services, including
offloading computation from a set of clients, balancing computational
load among the servers, and providing failover capabilities, in
addition to acting as a distributed worker.

<P>
On a Windows system, you will need to start Gurobi Remote Services by
selecting the <EM>Gurobi Remote Services</EM> menu item from the <EM>  Gurobi</EM> folder of the <EM>Start</EM> menu.  You should only do so
after you have installed the Gurobi license key file.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Firewalls</SPAN>

<P>
The next step after starting Gurobi Remote Services depends on
your anti-virus software and firewall settings.  Most anti-virus
software will ask you to confirm that you are allowing programs
<code>grb_rs.exe</code> and <code>grb_rsw.exe</code> to receive network traffic.
Once you confirm this, Gurobi Remote Servides will start serving
requests.  If you don't receive such a prompt, you will need to add
<code>grb_rs.exe</code> and <code>grb_rsw.exe</code> to the firewall exceptions
list.  Select <EM>Allow a program through Windows firewall</EM> under
the <EM>Security</EM> area of the Control Panel (labeled <EM>Allow an
  app through Windows firewall</EM> in Windows 8).

<P>
Some machines have more restrictive firewalls that may require
additional action.  Gurobi Remote Services uses ports 61000-65000 by
default.  If you are unable to reach the Compute Server after taking
the steps described, ask your network administrator
for more information on how to open the required ports.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Gurobi Remote Services parameters</SPAN>

<P>
Note that Gurobi Remote Services has a few user-configurable parameters.
You can set these by creating a <code>grb_rs.cnf</code> file and placing
it in the same directory as <code>grb_rs.exe</code>.  Please
consult the
<A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="../refman/gurobi_remote_services.html">Gurobi Remote Services section of the Reference Manual</A>
for details.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Starting and stopping the grb_rs Gurobi service</SPAN>

<P>
Once Gurobi Remote Services has been started, you should see the
<code>grb_rs</code> service listed in the <EM>Services</EM> tab of the Task
Manager.  To start or stop the service, click on the <EM>Services</EM>
button at the bottom-right of the <EM>Services</EM> tab, and then
right-click on the <EM>Gurobi Remote Services</EM> item on this screen.

<P>
You can also start or stop Gurobi Remote Services from a Console
window with administrator privileges.  Running <code>grb_rs -h</code> lists
command-line options.  Issuing a <code>grb_rs -s</code> command stops Gurobi
Remote Services.  If you are unfamiliar with running command-line
commands on a Windows system, you can learn more
<A HREF="windows_command_line.html#section:windowscommandline">here</A>.

<P>
Add the line
<PRE>
VERBOSE=1
</PRE>
to your <code>gurobi.lic</code> file to start Gurobi Remote Services in verbose
mode.  Verbose mode produces a log message (in the Windows Event Log)
each time a client starts a job.

<P>
All output from Gurobi Remote Services goes to the Windows Event
Log.  You can access this in Windows Vista or Windows 7 through the
Event Viewer.  Type <EM>Event</EM> in the search box under the
<EM>Start</EM> menu to launch the viewer.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Next steps</SPAN>

<P>
Once you've set up Gurobi Remote Services, you should test
the state of the server.  Type this command on your server:
<PRE>
gurobi_cl --server=localhost --status
</PRE>
If the output includes the following line:
<PRE>
Gurobi Remote Services functioning normally
</PRE>
then Remote Services is ready for use.

<P>
Client programs will need to know how to reach your server.
If you are using Gurobi Compute Server, this is typically done with a
<A HREF="creating_a_compute_server_.html#subsection:clientlicensecompute">client license file</A>.
You should set that up now.

<P>
If you've set up distributed workers in order to run a distributed
algorithm, you'll use the
<A NAME="tex2html14"
  HREF="../refman/workerpool.html">WorkerPool</A>
parameter to
tell the client machine how to access the servers.  When you are
ready, you can obtain more information in the
<A NAME="tex2html15"
  HREF="../refman/distributed_parallel_algor.html">distributed algorithm section of the Reference
  Manual</A>
