Retrieving a Compute Server license
</H3>

<P>
If you have purchased one or more Gurobi Compute Server licenses,
you'll need to perform a few setup steps in order to start your
Compute Servers.  Once started, client machines will be able to
offload the work of solving an optimization model onto these servers.
The clients and the Compute Servers can run any mix of supported
operating systems.  Thus, for example, multiple Linux machines could
submit jobs to a pair of Compute Servers, one running Windows and the
other running Linux.  Any machine that can reach the Compute Server(s)
over your network can be a client (including the Compute Servers
themselves).

<P>
Once you've chosen a machine to act as a Compute Server, you'll need
to run the <code>grbgetkey</code> command on that machine to retrieve your
Gurobi license key.  Note that the machine must be connected to the
Internet in order to run this command. An Internet connection is not
required after you have obtained your license key.

<P>
If your computer isn't connected to the Internet or if your network
security system does not allow the command below to function,
we also offer a
manual license key process.  You'll find manual instructions at the
bottom of the License Detail page (by following the link labeled
<EM>click here for additional instructions</EM>).

<P>
The exact command to run for a specific license is indicated at the
bottom of the License Detail page (e.g., <code>grbgetkey 253e22f3-...</code>).  We
recommend that you use copy-paste to copy the entire <code>grbgetkey</code>
command from our website and paste it directly into the Windows
<EM>Search</EM> box (and then hit <EM>Enter</EM>):

If you are unfamiliar with running command-line commands on a Windows
system, you can learn more
<A HREF="windows_command_line.html#section:windowscommandline">here</A>.

<P>
The <code>grbgetkey</code> program passes identifying information about
your machine back to our website, and the website responds with your
license key.  Once this exchange has occurred, <code>grbgetkey</code> will
ask for the name of the directory in which to store your license
key file (<code>gurobi.lic</code>).  You should see a prompt that looks
like this:

 SRC="./getkey_windows.png"
 ALT="Image getkey_windows">

</DIV>

<P>
You can store the license key file anywhere, but we strongly recommend
that you accept the default location by hitting <EM>Enter</EM>. Setting
up a non-default location is error-prone and a frequent source of
trouble.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Using a non-default license file location</SPAN>

<P>
When you run the Windows version of the Gurobi Optimizer, it will look
for the <code>gurobi.lic</code> key file in three different default
locations.  It will always look in your home directory.  In addition,
Gurobi Optimizer 6.0.0 will also look in <code>c:\gurobi</code> and
<code>c:\gurobi600</code>.  Note that these default paths are absolute, so
for example Gurobi will look for the license key file in
<code>c:\gurobi</code>, even if the software is installed in
<code>d:\gurobi</code>.

<P>
If you would like to use a non-default license key file
location, you can do so by setting environment variable
<code>GRB_LICENSE_FILE</code> to point to the license key file.  <EM>  Important note: the environment variable should point to the license
  key file itself, not to the directory that contains the file.</EM>

<P>
On Windows systems, environment variables are created and modified
through the Control Panel.  Searching for <EM>Environment Variables</EM>
from the Control Panel search box will lead you to the
appropriate screen.  You will need to add a new <EM>System variable</EM>
named <code>GRB_LICENSE_FILE</code>, and set it to the
location of your license file (e.g., <code>d:\gurobi\gurobi.lic</code>).
<EM>Important note: your new environment variable must be a System variable, not a User variable.</EM>

<P>
Once you have followed the steps above and have obtained
a license key file, your next step is to
