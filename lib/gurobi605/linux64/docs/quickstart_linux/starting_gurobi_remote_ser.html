Starting Gurobi Remote Services
</H2>

<P>
<B>Important note: you only need to start Gurobi Remote Services if you are
  setting up a Compute Server or a distributed worker (for use in distributed
  algorihms).  If you are not
  sure whether you need to start Gurobi Remote Services, you can examine the
  contents of your <code>gurobi.lic</code> file.  If it contains the line
  <code>CSENABLED=1</code>, then you need Gurobi Remote Services.
  If it contains a line that begins with <code>DISTRIBUTED=</code>, and if
  you plan to run distributed algorithms, then you also need Gurobi
  Remote Services.</B>

<P>
On Linux systems, Gurobi Remote Services is a daemon that allows a
server to perform Gurobi computations on behalf of other client
machines.  The set of services the server provides depends on your
license.  If you are setting up a machine as a distributed worker, no
license is required.  In this case, the only service provided by the
server is to act as a worker in a distributed algorithm.  If you have
a Compute Server license, then servers running Gurobi Remote Services
can provide a variety of services, including offloading computation
from a set of clients, balancing computational load among the servers,
and providing failover capabilities, in addition to acting as a
distributed worker.

<P>
To start the Gurobi Remote Services daemon, run the program
<code>grb_rs</code> (with no arguments) on your server.  You only need to do
this once -- Gurobi Remote Services will keep running until you stop
it (or until the machine is shut down).  If you are setting up a
Gurobi Compute Server, be sure that the license key file has been
installed before starting Gurobi Remote Services.  Note that Gurobi
Remote Services runs as a user process, so you do not need root
privileges to start it.

<P>
If you would like Gurobi Remote Services to restart automatically when the
machine is rebooted, there are a number of options for doing so
(including <code>/etc/rc.local</code> and <code>upstart</code>).  You should talk
to your system administrator.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Gurobi Remote Services parameters</SPAN>

<P>
Note that Gurobi Remote Services has a few user-configurable parameters.
You can set these by creating a <code>grb_rs.cnf</code> file and placing
it in the same directory as <code>grb_rs</code>.  Please
consult the
<A NAME="tex2html11"
  HREF="../refman/gurobi_remote_services.html">Gurobi Remote Services section of the Reference Manual</A>
for details.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Starting and stopping the grb_rs Gurobi daemon</SPAN>

<P>
To stop Gurobi Remote Services if it is already running, you can issue the
<code>grb_rs -s</code> command.  You can also use the <code>ps</code> command to
find the relevant process ID, and the <code>kill</code> command to terminate
that process.

<P>
Output from Gurobi Remote Services goes to the system log
(<code>/var/log/syslog</code>).  You should see a message similar to the
following when you start the server:
<PRE>
Mar  9 12:37:21 mymachine grb[7917]: Gurobi Remote Services started: Sat Mar  9 12:37:21 2014
</PRE>
By default, Gurobi Remote Services only produces logging output when it
starts.  Start Gurobi Remote Services with the <code>-v</code> switch to obtain
more detailed logging information.  For example, this option will
generate a log message each time a client job starts

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Firewalls</SPAN>

<P>
If you run into trouble accessing Gurobi Remote Services,
check to see if the server is running firewall software that
might be blocking access to some ports.  Gurobi Remote Services uses
port numbers 61000-65000 by default, so you'll need to open access to
these ports on the server.  Please consult the documentation for your
firewall software to determine how to do this.  If there's a conflict
on the default port, you can choose a different one by adding a
<code>PORT</code> line <EM>to both the server and the client license key
  files</EM>:
<PRE>
PORT=46325
</PRE>
You can choose any available port number.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Next steps</SPAN>

<P>
Once you've set up Gurobi Remote Services, you should test
the state of the server.  Type this command on your server:
<PRE>
gurobi_cl --server=localhost --status
</PRE>
If the output includes the following line:
<PRE>
Gurobi Remote Services functioning normally
</PRE>
then Remote Services is ready for use.

<P>
Client programs will need to know how to reach your server.
If you are using Gurobi Compute Server, this is typically done with a
<A HREF="creating_a_compute_server_.html#subsection:clientlicensecompute">client license file</A>.
You should set that up now.

<P>
If you've set up distributed workers in order to run a distributed
algorithm, you'll use the
<A NAME="tex2html12"
  HREF="../refman/workerpool.html">WorkerPool</A>
parameter to
tell the client machine how to access the servers.  When you are
ready, you can obtain more information in the
<A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="../refman/distributed_parallel_algor.html">distributed algorithm section of the Reference
  Manual</A>
